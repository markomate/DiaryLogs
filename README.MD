# DiaryLogs

DiaryLogs is a one-stop-app for those who would like to easily log their work hours and add notes for future reference. This makes DiaryLogs sutible for anyone working, especially for those with multiple jobs looking for an easy way to calculate their hours for a given pay period. It is still useful for those on salary as you can review and export your notes and sick days which will compliment you at your next promotion/job interview!

### Features:
- Able to simply create an account to store your job information and track your logs.
- An intuative calendar for clear visibility of what logs have been made and to easily create new logs.
- A log can simply be a start and finish time, extra break, some notes, a sick day or a variety mentioned.
- A simple to use paid hours calculator which has two inputs, a start date and end date which outputs worked hours minus unpaid breaks (if specified in job settings).
- Users are able to add as many jobs as they'd like and can colour code them to their preference for their calendar.
- Dark mode to reduce eye strain in low light scenarios.
